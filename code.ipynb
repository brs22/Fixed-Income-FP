In other words, it is more important for how long we are going to hold forward rate once it starts paying the cash flow than then in what exact period of time we are going to do it.

relatively low. Sharpe ratio is lower for long-term bonds, mainly because the volatility of excess returns rises sharply with increase in maturity. Holding long term bonds is useful if we do not need money in near term (pension plan for example). We can buy long term bonds after the crisis period when yields are high, expecting the price of the bond to rise as economy recovers. Also, being short in long term bonds can be used for hedging the short and mid term bonds against the interest rate risk, which is another reason for having long term bonds in portfolio (although with negative weights)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1G8u71d-KZmJ"},"source":["(b) In the lecture notes, we provided results based on the following (one-step-ahead) predictive regression analysis for n-year zero-coupon bonds (n = 2, 3, 4, 5) for the period 1964M1–2021M05:\n","$$rx_{t+1}^{(n)} = a^{(n)} + b^{(n)}(f_{t}^{(n)} − y_{t}^{(1)}) + ε_{t+1}^{(n)},$$\n","where $rx_{t+1}^{(n)}:=r_{t+1}^{(n)} − y_{t}^{(1)}$ is the excess bond return over the period $[t, t+1]$, and $f_{t}^{(n)}$ is the forward rate for the period $[t + n − 1, t + n]$.\n",">(b.1)  **(6 pts)** Run the above regression for the following periods: 1964M1–1973M12, 1974M1–1983M12, 1984M1–1993M12, 1994M1–2003M12, 2004M1–2013M12,\n","and 2014M1–2021M05.

Also in the period of 2019 and Covid crisis the MSE is growing (although only 0.0004, but this is due to squared error, which means it is of the same magnitude as the data used to compute it). This is why results of the model do not appear staitstically significant.
